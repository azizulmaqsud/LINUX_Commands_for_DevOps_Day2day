# Manually set up a repository

create a .repo file within /etc/yum.repos.d using a text editor. Here I am creating the repository file for MySQL 5.7

Step1 :
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/

Step2:
vim mysql57-community.repo
[mysql57-community]
name=MySQL 5.7 Community Server
baseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql

Step4:
yum install mysql

# YUM CONFIGURTION

•YUM stands for Yellow Dog Updater Manager.
•Yum is the default package management utility in RHEL/Centos.
•Yum uses repository to get the necessary rpm files.
•A repository is collection of rpm files.
•Repository may contain multiple versions of the same RPM package.
•Repository may contain different builds for different architectures for example one for i686 and other for x86_64.
•A repository can be configured locally or remotely.

Repository configuration files are stored in /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory with an extension .repo

vi /etc/yum.repos.d/example.repo

[examplerepo]			// label of repository
name=examplerepo		// name of repository.
baseurl=file:///rhcelab/repo	// define the location of rpm files.
enabled=1	                // value = 1 means enabled. or, 0 means repository is disabled.
gpgcheck=0	                // value = 1 means integrity will be checked. or, 0 means integrity will not be checked.
:wq	                        // save and quit from file.

# CONFIGURE IP NETWORKING WITH NMCLI

yum install NetworkManager
systemctl start NetworkManager
systemctl enable NetworkManager  (make sure it is up 24/7)
nmcli connection show --active
nmcli device status
nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname eth0
nmcli connection show 
nmcli connection up ethernet-eth0
nmcli connection show --active

To Change the Linux system IP ADDRESS:
nmcli connection modify ethernet-eth0 ipv4.address 172.31.16.0/24
nmcli connection modify ethernet-eth0 ipv4.method manual

To modify IPV4 Gateway:
nmcli connection modify ethernet-eth0 ipv4.gateway “172.31.16.2”

To modify the DNS:
nmcli connection modify ethernet-eth0 ipv4.dns “172.31.16.101”

# Reset Root Password in Linux CentOS:

Boot to Recovery Mode. When system restarts, press “ESC” key to interrupt the boot process. 
Select the kernel from the GRUB/Boot menu; press the arrow keys.
Pressing ‘e’ from your keyboard will open the editing menu.
In the editing menu, locate the “ro” kernel parameter and replace it with “rw”. 
Add an additional parameter “init=/sysroot/bin/sh”
Press Ctrl + X to enter into single-user mode 
Run the “chroot /sysroot” command to convert the root file to read and write mode
Set a new password for root, command: passwd root (Changing the password for user root)
SELinux relabelling (to set the permissions for files or folders)
Exit from terminal
Hit reboot


# Create a .tar backup
tar -cvf backup.tar finaldraft.sh
tar -czf backup.tar.gz finaldraft.sh 
tar -xvfz backup.tar.gz

Exclude files when creating a tar backup
tar --exclude file.txt --exclude file.sh -cvfz backup.tar.gz

Extract content from a tar (.gz) backup
tar -xvfz backup.tar.gz

Here:
-c - Create the archive
-v - Show the process verbosely
-f - Name the archive
-x - Extract the content
-z - Compressed gzip archive file

# Tunning Linux system
Profile tuned are divided into power-saving profiles, and performance-boosting profiles. 
The performance-boosting profiles include profiles focus on the following aspects:
- low latency for storage and network
- high throughput for storage and network
- virtual machine performance
- virtualization host performance

TuneD recommends the most suitable profile for your system, commands:
yum install tuned
systemctl enable --now tuned
yum install tuned-profiles-realtime 
tuned-adm active  (Verify that a TuneD profile is active and applied)
tuned-adm verify
tuned-adm recommend
tuned-adm profile powersave

# Create Group

useradd   //adds accounts
usermod   //modifies accounts
userdel   //deletes accounts
groupadd  //adds groups
groupmod  //modifies groups
groupdel  //deletes groups

groupadd [-g gid [-o]] [-r] [-f] groupname

# Create Account

useradd -d /home/example/ -g testers -s /bin/bash -m example


# SELinux [Security Enhanced Linux]
It is an access control system built into the Linux kernel. It enforces resource policies according to level of user access, programs, and services.

SELINUX=enforcing|permissive|disabled   //It Defines the top- level state of SELinux on a system.

enforcing — The SELinux security policy is enforced.
permissive — The SELinux system prints warnings but does not enforce policy.
disabled — SELinux is fully disabled. SELinux hooks are disengaged from the kernel and the pseudo-file system is unregistered.

SELINUXTYPE=targeted|strict    //It Specifies which policy SELinux should enforce.
targeted — Only targeted network daemons are protected.
strict — Full SELinux protection, for all daemons. Security contexts are defined for all subjects and objects, and every action is processed by the policy enforcement server.

To check SELinux:

sestatus  
cat /etc/selinux/config

To Change SELinux Mode:

vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux
SELINUX=enforcing
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
:wq!

# Create Cron Job
Example: send email to evrey monday 5 pm, how to exec in cron job in linux?

Enter the following command to edit the crontab file:
crontab -e

In the crontab file, add the following line to schedule the cron job:

0 17 * * MON /sh/opt/script.sh

Save the crontab file and exit the text editor.


# SWAP PARTITION 
For Prioritization and Hibernation, and if your RAM fills up completely, then AWAP Partition comes in the picture!

1st way:
Use fdisk to create a disk partition of type 82 (Linux swap) 

Initialize the partition (for example, /dev/sda2) as a swap partition:

mkswap /dev/sda2
Enable swapping to the swap partition:

swapon /swapfile
Add an entry to /etc/fstab for the swap partition so that the system uses it following the next reboot:

/dev/sda2       swap       swap       defaults       0 0

2nd way:
Create a swap partition fdisk /dev/vda
Press n              [for new ]
+512 M
t                    [type for SWAP partition number is 82]
w 		     [quit]
partprobe /dev/vda3  [To hit the kernel about new partition]
mkswap /dev/vda3     [To use the swap partition] 
mount –a             [To check errors]
vi /etc/fstab        [For permanent mount]
/dev/vda3 swap swap 
swapon -s
df -h                [Recheck file]

# Logical Volume Management (LV)
It combines multiple individual hard drives and/or disk partitions into a single volume group (VG). 
New VG can be subdivided into logical volumes (LV) or used as a single large volume.

fdisk -l  [to see mapper]

Steps:
Install a new hard disk drive
Designate Physical Volumes
pvcreate /dev/vda1

Manage Volume Groups
vgcreate vgname /dev/vda1

Manage Logical Volumes, VG can be subdivided into one or more LVs
lvcreate -L size -n lvname vgname  [size maybe anything like 500MB..]

Logical volumes- 8e
fdisk /dev/vda
n
+500M
t ->8e
:wq!


Reboot the VM
pvcreate /dev/vdb
vgcreate –s 16 test /dev/vdb
lvcreate –l 30 –n new test
Mkdir /mnt/storage

MAKE VFAT FILE SYSTEM
A virtual file allocation table (VFAT) is an extension to the file allocation table (FAT) from Windows 95 and onward for creating, storing and managing files with long names.

Mkfs.vfat /dev/test/new
Vim /etc/fstab
/dev/test/new /mnt/storage vfat
/dev/test/new
